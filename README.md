# Html2pdf
Version 1.0.0

# Description
The html2pdf BB Component is a direct implementation of eKoopmans' html2pdf JS script. The component allows users to export a container of choice to PDF. It works by essentially taking a screenshot of the container and then printing it to PDF. Unfortunately, text cannot be selected as it is printing a 'screenshot', will look into ocrmypdf implementation in the future to hopefully solve this issue.
